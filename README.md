### Thanks for visiting my page!

I started my web development journey during community college when I took a networking class and had the fortune of meeting a software developer. Their stories inspired me and sparked my interest in beginning a career path into Web Development. 

Equipped with an Associate's degree in Web Design & Development from Lewis & Clark Community College, I continued to advance my education by enrolling in the Washington University St. Louis Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. There, I jumped into a wide range of topics, furthering my knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery, while also studying new languages and skills such as Git, REST APIs, Node, Express, SQL, MongoDB, and React. Graduating with newfound confidence in my web development abilities in December 2022, I'm eager to continue learning and gain experience.

My journey to becoming a Front-End Web Developer has been fulfilling and rewarding. I am a lifelong learner and embrace new opportunities. I am grateful for the experiences, opportunities, and help that I have along the way.
